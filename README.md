# Candidate Search

## Description

This project is of a candidate search application using GitHub API and rendering data in the browser. Data is retrieved from GitHub API to receive candidates and suitable ones can be saved and displayed in a "Potential Candidates" page. Working on this project helped to develop skills in React and TypeScript usage in React. This project also helped to develop my understanding of APIs, how to develop software to handle APIs and Render deployment.
